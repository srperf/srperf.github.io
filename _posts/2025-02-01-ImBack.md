![Changes 2025](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpdwof2hx/image/upload/f_avif,q_auto/srPerfBlogMedia/2025-02-01-ImBack/headImg.png)

It is already February, 2025. I had a bit over a month of rest. Now it is time to explain a few things about what happened last 2024 and what is going to happen this 2025!

## Why disapear Dec24-Jan25?

Many may not know but 2024 was a weird and a bit chaotic year for me. It made me end it up unemployed and needing to somewhat disapear, rest, focus on healh (body, mind and soul) and figure out things.

During 2024 a few things happened:
- I was moved from DevReling k6 to DevReling focused completely on Grafana, which took away support for testing related conferences.
- I was finally accepted to many big (testing) conferences I had been trying to go for years and one cannot step back from those.
- Things happened indicating that soon I may be moving out of Mexico.

So I could say that from the moment I was moved it was a huge struggle to balance all and during August I decided to hold until November-December juggling the job with the conferences and call it quits to one of them, the work or the testing world, and focus on fully transitioning to one. 

## Changes were done

Saldy in August I found that work was not bringing me joy, and after someone told me "A happy Leandro is very important", I decided to quit work and dedicate December and January to heal and recover.

The plan was to survive to all the conference commitments I had while at the same time deliver what was needed from me from work. That involved a lot of traveling (which I usually do happyly), presenting at conferences, burning all my PTO, and when I could not burn it work at night on my job duties.

When I was done with work and conferences I was drained. Physically. Emotionally. And as I totally think I burned the candle on both ends, something was broken in me that for me to feel the spark of joy in conferencing and creating content; I needed reflection, rest, and family moments. That involved holidays with family, lots of videogame playing (I rocked MegaMan ZX and SF6), lots of reading (I finished 5 books!), long forest walks, back to fitness classes, sleeping more and so on.

## Whats going on now?

So as of today, first week of Feb-2025, I am not employed and I am not in a hurry to find work, fortunately.

My wife also experienced some changes which will bring another change this year. We will move to Germany mid 2025!

On the other hand, being uneployed will give me chance to focus a bit more on Señor Performo, the moving, health (both physical and mental) and above all, to be happy.

## Goals for 2025

Given what is coming up soon in my life, I think it would not be wise to be employed, so these are the things I am gonna be working on this year. They are sorted more or less in the priority I should be working on them:

1. Moving to Germany

  This one will be a huge endeavor. Packing my life. Leaving lots of what I cannot pack. Work out the logistics, paperwork, processes, and all that will be needed for me to say on Jan 2026 "I live in Germany".

  That will be a big endeavor that I do not want to underestimate. And a sub task here brings up my next goal.

2. Getting better with my German   

  For the visa I will apply in Germany, I will need to pass a language exam which I am pretty sure at the moment, my Tarzanesque German is not fit to pass. So this one is key. Ich muss besser deutsche sprëchen!
   
3. Create at least one performance course

  For some years now I have struggled to find the time to create some courses uploadable to platforms like Udemy, or to host them myself, or all of the above! This will be especially important as now being on my own, I will need to bring some bacon home.

4. Translate my first book

  A bit aligned with the bacon bringing, and with the projects I have delayed for years now. "The hitchhiking Guide To Load Testing Projects" will be translated to Spanish so many of my people who struggle with English, will be able to get on the knowledge. And who knows, I may manage to push a bit of progress on my second book, the continuation of my first which I have the tentative title "Thank you for the Continuous Performance Fish", in English to start.
   
5. More YouTube content

  I still want to foster my channels. Yes, plural. I want to tackle a bit more content to my English channel, which was a bit unattended the last few years. But as well try to keep up content in Spanish in my larger channel!
   
6. Conferences

  Last but not least some conferences. I will not be as ambitious this year as I was on previous ones. With so many things happening in my life this year, I think it is wise to focus and don't let myself end up this year as destroyed as I ended last 2024. But still I wanna join my conference family and share some performance and o11y with the world!

## Closing

This blog post is a cathartic attempt at getting these plans deep in my mind, my subsconscious, my soul, and of course being written is a great guideline.

This year my focus will be on health. Making sure I do this country moving in the healthiest possible way. But I will never forget this urge I have on sharing knowledge with the world!

Let's see how well I can keep up my plans stated in this post. Stay tuned for all these things coming!

<3 Besos!
